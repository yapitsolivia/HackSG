# HackSG Theme: Sustainability

Project Title: Sustainerise

Project Summary: Our website, Sustainerise is a platform which provides an avenue for consumers to make more environmentally conscious dining decisions. After investigating the sustainability of different eateries in Singapore, we partnered with eateries that we deemed as sustainable. Consumers can then use our website to identify and show their support towards sustainable eateries. Sustainerise also offers consumers rewards for every reservation made with a sustainable eatery. We hope that through this platform, consumers can be more aware of the environmental impacts of their dining decisions, hopefully encouraging them to consume sustainably.

Overview of the Problem: In the last 50 years, the global population has consumed more goods and services than the combined total of all previous generations (Tillard 2000). This growth in consumption has fostered economic growth and improved the quality of life for many. However, the current unsustainable consumption patterns have also accelerated environmental degradation and that is mainly attributed to the consumers’ lack of awareness of the environmental costs of different products and services. The lack of awareness is mainly due to the lack of easy accessibility to the information on the environmental costs of different goods and services (Sustainability Concepts: Sustainable Consumption (gdrc.org)). Thus, the aim of our digital product is to make these environmental costs of companies more accessible to the consumers, so they can more easily identify the sustainable companies. For this project, we are narrowing our scope to focus on the food industry in Singapore. One reason is that there is no app or website currently available that offers sustainable food options based on user’s location and preferences, especially in Singapore.

Project Details
How it Works: 
Consumers who are looking for places to eat will be able to go on our website, and look for possible restaurants based on their preferences. 
The list of restaurants will then be filtered based on the cuisine type. Consumers will then be able to make a direct reservation with the restaurant from our website at the click of a button. A reward system will be in place whereby users are able to collect points every time a reservation is made through the website. Accumulation of points will allow users to redeem the points in exchange for website-wide discount vouchers.
How it helps:
It offers consumers sustainable dining options tailored to their cuisine choice. This allows consumers to be more aware of the sustainability of their favourite eateries. In the long run, this hopefully encourages consumers to gradually change their consumption habits to more sustainable ones. The reward system would also be able to provide an incentive for consumers to continue utilising this platform regularly. 
Feasibility:
Database of all the restaurants in Singapore and the sustainable habits they practice would have to be created so we can decide if they are suitable to include on our website or not. This would be a relatively tedious process as in-depth research would have to be conducted about every single restaurant on the website, regarding any sustainable or unsustainable habits they’re adopting. There needs to be a sustainability threshold for restaurants to be included, where we have to decide what exactly the sustainability limit is for inclusion of a restaurant on our website. Furthermore, restaurants may not be so forthcoming about information such as their food suppliers, or food recycling habits if they are unsustainable, which makes it more difficult to calculate their sustainability score.
The website would have to partner with the restaurants on it to allow for the direct booking system and discount vouchers to be feasible. This is relatively feasible as being on the website would allow the restaurant to increase its exposure, and be able to connect to more consumers, acting as an incentive for restaurants to be a part of our website. However, some restaurants already have their own booking system in place so we would need to find a way to integrate our new system with their preexisting one.

Future Plans:
In the future, the website could be expanded to more industries instead of just the food industry. It can be expanded to the retail industry where consumers would be able to search for sustainable products on our website and purchase them through our website. However, as there are a lot more retail providers compared to restaurants, we could adopt a different system for the retail industry where shops have to register with the website to sell items on it, rather than the website approaching the stores for a partnership. The stores would then have to submit a sustainability report to the website to ensure that the stores are sustainable. Once this has been verified, we will then place the store on the website where it will become available to consumers.
